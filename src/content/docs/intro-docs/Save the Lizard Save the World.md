[[Cap-O]]  who was hired by the mayor of [[Drellin's Ferry]]. is meeting the party at the Skull Gorge Bridge before heading into [[Drellin's Ferry]] to help with the investigation. But when the party arrives they find there has been an goblin incursion and [[Cap-O]] has been kidnapped. The party has tracked the Goblins too outside their lair, and have come upon a goblin's around a fire. 

### 1st mission phrased dramatically.
#### *Cue dramatic music*
*As you approach Skull Gorge Bridge, Cap-O is nowhere to be found. In his place, you find signs of a struggle—a broken campfire, his torn map, and the distinct marks of goblins.*

*The tracks lead you deeper into the woods, the scent of smoke hanging heavy in the air. Soon, you spot a small group of goblins gathered around a fire, laughing and jeering. Cap-O’s cloak drapes over one of their heads.*

*They’ve taken him, but they’ll regret it.*

*The hunt begins now.*
