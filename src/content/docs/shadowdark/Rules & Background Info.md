title: Shadowdark Rules
---
# Background
The mightiest king of the sea wolves, Skorgald, lies entombed in the sea caves, carried to Valhalla with the hoard he won in life. It's said his rotting head rests on piles of gold, and his hands still clutch the bejeweled crosses and crowns he reaped from those he conquered.

King Skorgald will live on in legend amongst your people. You won't... yet! Raiding is the right of the strong, and so you go to the sea caves to seize your fortune and make your name. If old king Skorgald is still worthy of his hoard, then let him rise up to defend it!
# Adventuring
### CRAWLERS 
Those who dare the lost halls and caverns of the Shadowdark are called by many names. Crawlers, delvers, explorers, adventurers, treasure hunters.

In this chapter, you'll learn how to crawl with the best of them. Whether you're exploring a lightless barrow mound or the Shrouded Forest of Eld, the rules herein will guide you. 
### OUTSIDE THE SHEET
The first step to crawling is understanding your environment and imagining an action you want to take. 

Don't simply scour your character sheet for ideas and options! Your crawling career depends on your ability to "think outside the sheet."

Imagine what you would really do if you were in your character's situation. Do you see a suit of armor in an alcove? Maybe you lift the helm's visor and make sure nothing is looking back at you.

Do you hear faint voices behind a rotting, wooden door? Maybe you creep up and press your ear against it to hear what's happening on the other side. 

Is a band of orcs chasing you and your companions down a hallway? Maybe tearing the decrepit tapestries from the walls will hamper their pursuit.

None of the above ideas are listed on a character sheet. Although you should use your stats, spells, gear, and talents, don't limit yourself only to those. 
# Rolling the Dice

### ADVANTAGE 
When you have advantage on a roll, it means you're in a strong position to succeed. For example, you might be attacking from the high ground, or you might have just failed at a task and now have insight into how to succeed if you try again. To roll with advantage, roll the same die twice and use the better result. 
### DISADVANTAGE 
When you have disadvantage on a roll, it means you're in a strong position to fail. For example, you might be trying to strike an enemy while blinded by sand, or navigating a maze while confused by disorienting poison. To roll with disadvantage, roll the same die twice and use the worse result. 
### CANCELING 
If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a roll, they cancel each other out.
### NATURAL 20 
When a d20 die roll shows a 20, what you're doing succeeds to your maximum capacity. An attack roll automatically hits and is a critical hit (see Damage on pg. 89). 
### NATURAL 1 
When a d20 die roll shows a 1, what you're doing fails to your maximum capacity. An attack roll automatically misses and might even strike an ally. 
### THE D6 DECIDER 
If there's a random chance for an outcome, such as whether a dropped torch goes out, the GM calls for a d6 roll. A 1-3 results in the worse outcome for the players, and a 4-6 results in the better one.
# Using Stats
Certain tasks fall under specific stats. The following examples illustrate common uses for each one. 

The difference between Intelligence and Wisdom can be tricky. If in doubt, remember Wisdom is for sensory acuity and instinct, while Intelligence covers knowledge and logic.
### STRENGTH
- Smashing open locked doors 
-  Bending the bars of a prison cell or sewer grate 
-  Lifting a large rock overhead 
-  Stopping a runaway ship's helm from spinning 
### DEXTERITY
-  Diving away from a trap that flings a hail of needles 
-  Disabling a tripwire without activating it
-  Scaling a sheer castle wall
-  Fooling onlookers with sleight of hand tricks 

### CONSTITUTION
-  Holding your breath underwater 
-  Withstanding intense pain 
-  Resisting the effects of poison 

### INTELLIGENCE
-  Giving first aid to a dying character 
-  Recalling the path through a twisting maze
-  Finding food and water sources in the wilderness

### WISDOM
- Spotting a well-hidden enemy 
 - Determining the direction of a faint noise or smell 
 - Deciphering the sounds on the other side of a door 

### CHARISMA 
- Performing ventriloquism 
- Applying a disguise
- Rallying allies who are terrified by a monster

# Making Checks

### WHEN TO ROLL?
Usually, you succeed at what you're trained to do without needing to roll a check. 

For example, a wizard is always able to read magical runes, and a thief always finds a trap if searching in the right area. 

If you take the time to scan the sky for threats or examine a stretch of wall for a secret door, you simply succeed. 

Social encounters usually rely on what you say rather than Charisma checks. Narrating a moving speech or using secret information you gathered to influence an NPC does not require a check to succeed. 

The GM asks for a check when the following is true:
• The action has a negative consequence for failure

• The action requires skill • There is time pressure 

### DIFFICULTY CLASS 
The four standard DCs represent how difficult an action is.

**Easy, DC 9**. Leaping a narrow chasm, sneaking up on an inattentive guard. Normal, DC 12. Kicking open a stuck door, picking a poor lock.

**Hard, DC 15**. Swimming against a strong current, giving first aid to stop a character from dying. 

**Extreme, DC 18**. Climbing a slippery cliff one-handed, restraining a frenzied lion. 

### CONTESTED CHECKS
If multiple creatures are working against each other on a conflicting task, a contested check decides who succeeds.

To make a contested check, each participant rolls one relevant stat check at the same time, even if it's not their turn. The highest result wins (reroll ties)

# Time
### REAL TIME
Time passes in the game world at the same pace it's passing in the real world. One minute or hour of game time is equal to one minute or hour in real time. 

This matters for tracking light sources, because most light sources only last for one hour of real time. 

If you can't track real time in your game, assume one hour is equal to 10 rounds. 

## TURNS AND ROUNDS 
A **turn** is a player's moment to describe what their character does to the GM. Players act one by one on each of their turns.

Some turns need a bit of room to breathe. A character who is speaking with someone can make a few reasonable exchanges back and forth. 

A **round** completes when each person has taken one turn. 

### TIME PASSES 
Every moment in the game doesn't have to be accounted for in real time. 

For example, if the characters want to spend 10 minutes examining a room from top to bottom, the GM and players can agree that time passes. 

When time passes, the GM and players move any timers down by that amount. 

**Minutes Pass.** Effects with a duration of rounds expire. The GM rolls one random encounter check that occurs on a 1-3 on a d6 while this time is passing.

**Hours/Days Pass.** Effects with a duration shorter than the time passed expire. The GM uses overland travel rules to check for encounters that occur while this time is passing 

After resolving encounters, the game world fast-forwards to the new point in time.

# Turn order
### INITIATIVE
Shadowdark RPG is played in turn order right from the start. 

At the beginning of the game, the GM establishes **initiative**, or the order in which the players act. Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their DEX modifier. The GM adds the highest DEX modifier of any monsters, if relevant. 

The person who rolled the highest takes the first turn, and the turn order moves clockwise from that individual. 

### FREEFORM MODE
Initiative need not be strict; some GMs keep only a loose round-robin, allowing the players to decide their turn order and actions before circling back to the GM's turn. 

Players might declare their actions as a group or act simultaneously, and the GM will need to adjudicate. A round passes once everyone has acted. 

### PLAYER TURN 
1. The player counts down any personal timers for spells and other effects. 

2. The player takes an action and may move up to near (split up in any way). The player can move near again if skipping an action. 

3. The GM describes what happens as a result of the player's turn. 
### GM TURN
1. The GM counts down any timers not tracked by players.

2. The GM checks for a random encounter, if needed. 

3. The GM takes actions and makes movements for any relevant creatures or environmental effects. 

4. The GM describes what the characters notice as a result of steps 1-3.

# Crawling
### THE SHADOWDARK 
The Shadowdark is any place where darkness, danger, and myth reign supreme. It could be in crumbling ruins, ancient mountain strongholds, or mysterious towers. It could be in gloomy forests, trap-laden pyramids, or haunted sea caves. As long as the characters are going into danger with swords, spells, and torches ready, they're going into the Shadowdark. 

### CRAWLING ROUNDS
Characters are in crawling rounds while not in combat. They are exploring, talking, and engaging with the environment. 

### VISION
All characters need light to see, but that's not true for the darkness-adapted beings of the Shadowdark. Note that any area outside of a light source's illumination is in total darkness. 

### LIGHT SOURCES 
Most light sources last for up to an hour of real time and illuminate a limited area. 

Players have two options when lighting more than one light source at a time:
4. The newer light source "rides along" on the current timer.

5. Extinguish all old light sources. Start a new timer with the fresh light source. 

The GM can make rulings counter to the above; the purpose is to make tracking light timers simple, not frustrating. 

### TOTAL DARKNESS
While in total darkness, a creature who is not darkness adapted has disadvantage on tasks it undertakes that require sight. Also, the environment becomes deadly. The GM checks for a random encounter every crawling round.

### MOVEMENT
**Distances.** Distances are broken up into close (5 feet), near (up to 30 feet), and far (within sight during an encounter or scene). 

**Climbing.** Strength or Dexterity check to climb half your speed. Fall if you fail by 5+ points. 

**Falling.** You take 1d6 damage for every 10 feet you fall. 

**Moving Through.** You can move freely through allies. You must pass a Strength or Dexterity check to move through enemies. 

**Swimming.** Swim half speed (requires a STR check in rough water). Make a CON check each round you hold your breath. On a failed CON check, 1d6 damage a round until you exit the hazard. 

### REGROUP
During crawling rounds, the GM can allow the players to regroup. PCs within reasonable reach of each other can come together into a marching order. They can also move as a group, taking a round each time. When needed, initiative shifts back to turns. 

### CONDITIONS 
Some effects impose a condition on a character, such as blindness or immobility. Advantage and disadvantage apply to most situations. Use common sense. For example, a blinded character has disadvantage on tasks requiring sight, and a PC stuck in a spider web can't move.

### ACTIONS
While crawling, characters can take actions that might include:
-  Prying a gem from a statue

-  Sneaking up on a slumbering manticore

-  Tapping on a suspicious wall to check for a hidden door

-  Scanning a room for signs of hidden enemies

-  Giving a rousing speech to a group of fearful townsfolk 

### ENCOUNTERS
An encounter occurs when any challenge presents itself that stops the characters' progress. See pg. 112 for information on random encounters.

# Combat
When a fight breaks out, combat rounds begin! 
### DETERMINE SURPRISE
The GM determines if any creatures are unaware of each other. A creature who surprises another takes one turn before a new initiative order is rolled. 

### COMBAT INITIATIVE!
After surprise turns, the GM calls for new initiative. Everyone makes a Dexterity check (the GM uses the highest Dexterity modifier of any monsters). 

The person with the highest result takes the first turn. Turns go clockwise from that person. 

### COMBAT TURNS 
Characters can take one action and move near on their turn, splitting up the movement however they want. Characters can move near again if they don't take an action. 

### ACTIONS 
**Melee Attack.** Melee attacks use melee weapons. Roll 1d20 + your Strength modifier + talent bonuses. You hit the target if your total is equal to or greater than its AC.

**Ranged Attack.** Ranged attacks use ranged weapons. Roll 1d20 + your Dexterity modifier + talent bonuses. You hit the target if your total is equal to or greater than its AC. 

**Cast A Spell.** Casting a spell takes one action (see Spellcasting on pg. 44). 

**Improvise.** Do an improvised action, such as swinging across a ravine on a vine. The GM might determine it requires a stat check or attack roll. 

**Multitask.** Characters can do small, parallel tasks on their turns, such as standing up, speaking, activating a magic item, or quaffing a potion. This doesn't typically use their action. 89

### DAMAGE
When you hit a target with an attack or spell, you damage it. Roll your weapon or spell's damage dice + relevant bonuses. The GM subtracts that amount from the target's hit points.

**Knockout.** You can choose to knock a creature unconscious instead of killing it if you reduce it to 0 hit points.

**Critical Hit**. You deal a critical hit if you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll or spellcasting check. For a weapon, double its damage dice on the attack. For a spell, you may double one of its numerical effects (see pg. 45). 

### TERRAIN
Attacking or casting a spell on a creature that is hiding at least half its body behind interposing terrain has disadvantage.

If you can't see a creature at all due to terrain, you can't target it.

Creatures can only move half the normal distance through terrain that hampers free movement, such as ice or deep mud. 

### MORALE 
Enemies who are reduced to half their number (or half their HP for a solo enemy) flee if they fail a DC 15 Wisdom check. For large groups, the GM makes one check with the leader's modifier. 
# Gauntlets
Gauntlets are deadly affairs where life is fragile and glory is hard-won. Players begin with four 0-level characters each, playing one at a time and replacing from their pool if their current character dies. 
#### Remember the following: 
- 0-level characters can wield all gear. Beginner's luck! 

- 0-level characters die when they reach 0 HP. 

- Characters can (and should) loot their fallen companions' bodies.

- Don't worry about tracking XP. 0-level characters who survive the sea caves with respectable treasure in tow graduate to 1st level.
